    "When working with a new dataset, one of the most useful ways to begin the analysis is to visualize the data. By using tables, histograms, box plots, and other visual tools, we can get a better idea of what the data may be able to tell us, and we can gain insights into the data that we may have not discovered otherwise.\n",

    "In this notebook we demonstrate some basic visualisations in Python, building our abilities to explore data from a graphical perspective.  We will use the 'tips' dataset, whose observations contain information about restaurant bills and tipping."
